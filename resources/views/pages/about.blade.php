        <p>
            Appreciation is fundamental in human life. Although each one of us is driven entirely by a different set of
            compulsions e.g. success, fame, honour, self-realisation etc. Human beings respond to appreciation expressed
            through recognition of good work done. This confirms that their deeds are worthy and valued; as such, satisfaction
            and  productivity increase to levels never seen before. This is a direct result of the motivation brought
            about by the reward. Hence, ‘a constant desire to improve’. <br><br>

            The Annual Insurance Excellence Awards shall partake the annual responsibility of Identifying, Recognising
            and Rewarding outstanding performance in the Insurance Industry in Tanzania.  The gala dinner red carpet event
            is intended to be Tanzania’s flagship gathering of the Insurance professionals, consultants, providers’,
            well-wishers, donors, academia, and political leadership, in a bid to create motivation, mass awareness and
            image boosting in the sector. <br><br>

            The awards ceremony shall be an undertaking by and for all key stakeholders in the Insurance industry in
            Tanzania and beyond. This is largely because stakeholders have an invaluable role to play when it comes to
            promoting and sustaining the Insurance business.
            Being an inaugural gathering planned and commissioned by Tanzania Insurance Regulatory Authority and Insurance
            Institute of Tanzania, key associations like; Tanzania Insurance Brokers Association, Association of Tanzania

            advancement of professionalism in the overall insurance industry in Tanzania. <br><br>
